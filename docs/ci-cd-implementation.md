- **Grouped Updates**: Logical grouping (Kubernetes, observability, security)
- **Weekly Infrastructure Updates**: GitHub Actions and Docker
- **Smart Scheduling**: Spread across weekdays to reduce noise
- **Team Integration**: Automatic reviewer assignment

## Makefile Integration

Enhanced Makefile provides local development commands that mirror CI/CD:

### Release Management
```bash
make release-check        # Verify release readiness
make release-prepare      # Interactive release preparation
make release-notes        # Generate release notes
make tag-release         # Create and push release tags
```

### Container Development
```bash
make docker-build-dev     # Build development images
make docker-scan         # Local vulnerability scanning
make docker-sbom         # Generate container SBOM
```

### GitHub Integration
```bash
make gh-workflow-status   # Check workflow status
make gh-release-create    # Create GitHub releases
make gh-workflow-logs     # View workflow logs
```

### Development Productivity
```bash
make quick-start         # New developer onboarding
make dev-reset           # Reset development environment
make benchmark           # Performance benchmarking
make profile            # Generate performance profiles
```

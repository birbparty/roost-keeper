## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced CRD Definition (`api/v1alpha1/managedroost_types.go`)

The `GRPCHealthCheckSpec` has been significantly enhanced to support advanced features:

```go
type GRPCHealthCheckSpec struct {
    Host                string                      // Target gRPC server host
    Port                int32                       // Target gRPC server port
    Service             string                      // Service name for health check (empty for overall server health)
    TLS                 *GRPCTLSSpec               // TLS configuration
    Auth                *GRPCAuthSpec              // Authentication configuration
    ConnectionPool      *GRPCConnectionPoolSpec    // Connection pool configuration
    RetryPolicy         *GRPCRetryPolicySpec       // Retry policy configuration
    EnableStreaming     bool                       // Enable streaming health checks (Watch method)
    LoadBalancing       *GRPCLoadBalancingSpec     // Load balancing configuration
    CircuitBreaker      *GRPCCircuitBreakerSpec    // Circuit breaker configuration
    Metadata            map[string]string          // Custom metadata for health check requests
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling

The implementation provides comprehensive error handling for all gRPC status codes:

- **NotFound**: Service not found
- **Unimplemented**: Health checking not implemented by service
- **DeadlineExceeded**: Health check timeout
- **Unavailable**: Service unavailable
- **PermissionDenied**: Permission denied
- **Unauthenticated**: Authentication failed
- **Custom Handling**: Graceful degradation for unknown errors

### Health Status Evaluation

The implementation correctly interprets gRPC Health Checking Protocol responses:

- **SERVING**: Service is healthy and ready to serve requests
- **NOT_SERVING**: Service is not serving requests
- **UNKNOWN**: Service health status is unknown

### Performance Optimizations

#### Connection Pooling
- Reuses gRPC connections across multiple health checks
- Configurable pool sizes and connection lifecycle management
- Automatic cleanup of unhealthy connections

#### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff with configurable parameters
- Smart retry for transient failures only
- Respects timeout constraints

#### Circuit Breaker
- Prevents cascade failures in distributed systems
- Configurable failure and recovery thresholds
- Automatic state transitions (Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed)

## Integration with Observability

### OpenTelemetry Integration

The gRPC health checker is fully integrated with the project's observability stack:

**Tracing:**
